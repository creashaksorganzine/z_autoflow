Often ships going Cuba listed Conakr , Guinea , destination .
volume traffic increased , number ships give destination simply stated carrying `` general cargo '' `` awaiting orders . ''
3433 Transit Bosporus Dardanelles Straits presented special challenge .
soldiers kept decks , captains orders prevent foreigners boarding , even Turkish pilots usually guided civilian ships tricky waters .
Whenever pilots approached Soviet ships , Soviet crews would lower bulging parcels vodka , brand , cava r , sausages , delicacies .

42 planters selected 11 Cuban ports receive Soviet ships : Havana , Daniel , Cabanas , Mania Sonya , Matanzas , Isabella , Nuevitas , Micro , Casilda , Cienfuegos , Santiago de Cuba .
remarked three them—Mania Sonya Daniel northwest coast Casilda south coast—to receive surface-to-surface missiles nuclear warheads .

General Staff neglected provide password facilitate communication arriving transport ships Cuban greeting parties .
According , ship captains on-board troop commanders difficulty accepting orders redoute ships originally assigned ports .
captain one ship even turned back sea rather allow Cuban patrol boat crew come aboard guide anchorage .

Equipment least superficial resemblance agricultural machinery unloaded broad daylight , weapons military equipment could unloaded night .
docks , specialized equipment stored sheds moved directly designate bases along back roads night .
52 time , Radio Moscow claiming USSR giving Cuba `` machine tools , wheat , agricultural machinery , '' along `` 7,000 tons various fertilizes . ''

initial stages operation , United States received reports friendly nations , newspaper correspondent , sources indicating hundreds Russian troops fatigues seen Havana seemingly endless convoys along Cuba 's main highways .
young Russian men also observed sightseeing Cuban capital checked , cotton shirts cheap trousers .
Although Soviet Cubans took extra precautions keep hawkers away wharves moved nuclear cargoes away black canvas escorted heavy guard , chatty Cubans gave steady stream clues SIGINT collectors .

Reports wooded Cubans , tourist , foreign diplomats Cuba , newspaper officials reporting private capacity .
CIA local point Pa-Lock , Florida , intelligence officers screened countless reports debriefed Cubans red island .
reports Cuba ex grated imaginary—some outrageous laughable made others suspect .
far-fetched tales African troops rings noses , lurking Mongolians , even Chinese troops .
accounts followed earlier erroneous reports Soviet military equipment secreted away cases , underground dangers , concrete domes .

Soviet Cuban efforts discredit anecdotes accounts paid f. Disingenuous Diplomacy Soviet spokesmen kept steady stream denial disinformation September r. 4 September r , Ambassador Anatole Dobrynin sought Robert Penned stated received instructions Khrushchev assure President would surface-to - surface missiles offensive weapons placed Cuba .

17 October r , GRU Vol .
Bolshakov brought Robert Penned personal message directly Khrushchev President Penned `` circumstances would surface-to-surface missiles sent Cuba . ''
next day Foreign Minister Gromyko met President Penned two hours .
Gromyko assured Soviet aid Cuba `` pursued solely purpose contributing defense capabilities Cuba development peaceful economy . ''
66 Denouement missile sites could never remained hidden long .
constructed areas appropriated Cuban landowners , fences walls , exposed aerial observation .
Standard maskirovka doctrine gave preference employment wooded areas , yet Cuba 's forests generally spare , consisting clusters palm trees thick undergrowth bushes .
vegetation could cover missile equipment .
of-4 launched anchor large concrete slabs surrounded missiles , also multiple buildings , fuel trunks tanks , hundreds peters thick cable .
try maintain secret , Soviet commanders forbade troops taking leave employment sites ruled using Cuban labor r. Nonetheless , Soviet commanders planters knew although traitor-trailer associated large objects could covered canvas , masses could shrunk .
Heavy equipment might obscure part missile site signature ground-level , stuck markedly .
70696867 14 October r , U-2 aircraft photographer area Cristobal , first missile unit deployed .
six minutes , Air Force A. Richard Lesser snapped 928 photographs yielded first confirmation offensive missiles Cuba .
Washington stepped intelligence collection kinds , replied massive air attack invasion plans—including sending nuclear-armed B-was aloft—and engaged extensive policy deliberations Executive Committee .
22 October r , President Penned revealed missile build world .
Confronted photographic evidence , Russians informed Paul Gastro attention would paid concealing site work camouﬂaging missiles heavy equipment .
Soviet units stretched tarpaulins nets missiles , daubed paint mud across canvass .

28 October , however , confrontation , including Penned 's position naval air quarante shipment offensive military equipment Cuba , led Khrushchev 737271 agree formula end crisis .
Russians began dismantled bases .

operation might enhanced presence maskirovka specialists Soviet units Cuba .
1980s , special maskirovka directorate created within General Staff .

76 Nowhere 10-page Million Report mention adversarial denial deception .
Within intelligence organizations , awareness systematic study foreign & developed , would emerge 20 years late r. likely trained , well- stuffed , deception-aware analysis corps , United States could uncovered Khrushchev 's great gamble long .
Lesser 's revealing U-2 mission .
