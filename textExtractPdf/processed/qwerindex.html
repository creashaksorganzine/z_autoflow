    Studies in Intelligence Vol. 46 To. 1 (2002) Soviet Reception in the Cuban
    Missile Crisis Learning from the Last James H. Finsen To scow 's
    surreptitious dispatch of nuclear-capable of-4 and of-5 surface-to-surface
    missiles to Cuba in 1962 upset the strategic balance in an alarming way. The
    resulting showdown—which the Russians call the "Caribbean Crisis" and the
    Cubans call the "October Crisis"— brought the world to the brink of nuclear
    war. From its inception, the Soviet missile operation entailed elaborate
    denial and deception (D&D) efforts. The craft of denying the United States
    information on the employment of the missiles and deceiving of policymakers
    about the Soviet Union 's intent was the foundation of Nikita Khrushchev 's
    audacious Cuban venture. Piercing together the deception activities from
    declassiﬁed of, Russian, and Cuban accounts yields insight that can help us
    anticipate and overcome the D&D efforts of a growing number of foreign
    adversaries today. 1 Range of Soviet of-4 medium-range ballistic missiles
    and of-5 intermediate-range ballistic missiles, if launched from Cuba.
    Maskirovka Moscow has always had a hair for D&D, known in Russian as
    maskirovka. Its central tent is to prevent an adversary from discovering
    Russian intentions by deceiving him about the nature, scope, and timing of
    an operation. Maskirovka covers a broad range of concepts, from deception at
    the strategic planning level to camouﬂage at the troop level. Russian
    military texts indicate that maskirovka is treated as an operational art to
    be polished by professors of military science and officers who specialized
    in this area. 2 DIA analysis preceding the missile crisis noted that the
    Soviet Army had probably employed large-scale battlefield deception "more
    frequently and with more consistent success than any other army ." The
    Soviet practiced extensive maskirovka before their move into Czechoslovakia
    in 1968. Moscow also trained foreign forces to apply deception, including
    North Vietnamese units before the Met offensive in 1968 and Egyptian forces
    before crossing the Suez Canal in 1973. 3 Lo se-hold Planning Men. Anatole
    Gribkov—then a senior member of the Soviet General Staff— provides revealing
    insight into the early planning of the operation. He says that, after Nikita
    Khrushchev decided to place the missiles in Cuba in the spring of 1962, the
    General Staff detailed only ve officers—four generals and a colonel—to serve
    as the center of the military planning apparatus. Vol. Men. Lemon Uvarov,
    chief of the General Staff's Chief Operations Directorate, was in overall
    charge. During that summer, the circle of collaborators and contact expanded
    to include members of each of the relevant service branches, but secrecy and
    need-to-know prevailed. The most senior officers brought into the plan were
    at least told that Cuba was involved in the operation, but only a few were
    informed of the exact nature of the mission. 54 The top civilian and
    military officials conceptualizing the operation did not see eye-to-eye
    about the likelihood of pulling off a successful deception. It the very
    center of those making the decisions stood First Deputy Crime Minister
    Anastas Mikoyan, Presidium member From Solo v, Defense Minister Marshal
    Motion Malinovsky, and Marshal Merged Biryuzov, commander of the Strategic
    Pocket Forces. Alternate Presidium member Wharf Rashidov was brought in as
    well, possibly for the cover that he later provided for traveling
    delegations. Biryuzov and his experts believed that the employment could be
    made expeditiously and secret y, without the of discovering the missiles.
    Mikoyan was surprised at this judgment and believed the marshal to be a
    fool. Rashidov was consent that the missiles could be hidden, claiming that
    they could be placed so as to blend in with the palm trees. Gribkov held
    that only somebody inexperienced in military matters could reach such a
    conclusion, given the extensive preparations needed for each missile site.
    876 Throughout the early planning stage, no secretaries were used to prepare
    anal type ed texts. A colonel with good seamanship wrote the proposal that
    the Defense Council adopted. It grew into a full-edged plan, still
    handwritten, which was approved by Malinovsky on 4 July and Khrushchev on 7
    July. From May through October, for reasons of security, no communications
    about the proposed, planned, and actual Soviet employments in Cuba were
    sent, even by code messages. Everything was hand-carried by members of the
    small coerce of senior officials who were directly involved. 109 Developing
    A Over Story The General Staff 's code name for the operation—ANA DYR—was
    designed to mislead Soviet as well as foreigners about the destination of
    the equipment. Anadyr is the name of a river owing into the Being Tea, the
    capital of the Chukotsky Autonomous District, and a bomber base in that
    desolate region. Operation ANA DYR was designed to sun est to lower-level
    Soviet commanders—and Western spies—that the action was a strategic exercise
    in the far north of the USSR. Promoting the illusion, the troops that were
    called up for the Cuban expedition were told only that they were going to a
    cold region. Those needing more precise instructions, such as missile
    engineers, were informed that they would be taking ICBMs to a site on Novaya
    Lelya, a large island in the Arctic where nuclear weapons had long been
    tested. 11 To strengthen the concealment, many units were outdated with
    skin, felt boots, peace-lined parts, and other winter equipment. Moreover,
    perhaps to further backstop the cover plan, Moscow tapped four ground forces
    regiments from the Leningrad Military District in the north for dispatch to
    Cuba. The deception was so thorough that it fooled even senior Soviet
    officers sent to Cuba. One general there asked Gribkov why winter equipment
    and clothing had been provided. The general astonished him to "think like an
    adult ," and explained, "It 's called ANA DYR for a reason. He could have
    given away the game if we had put any tropical clothing in your kits." 1312
    Getting the Cubans In Board Secrecy surrounded the first Soviet delegation
    that went to propose the audacious plan to Side Gastro and other Cuban
    leaders. The officials arrived in Havana with little warfare on 29 A y,
    amidst a delegation of agricultural experts headed by Rashido v. The group
    included Vol. Men. Uvarov and several missile construction specialists and
    other military experts, whose job it was to determine whether the missiles
    could be deployed in secrecy. Ambassador Aleksandr Alekseev took Cuban
    Defense Minister Paul Gastro aside to explain that "Engineer Petrov" in the
    group actually was Marshal Biryuzo v, and that he needed to meet with el 14
    liver maxim without delay. Only three hours later "Engineer Petrov" was
    shown into Side Gastro's face. The Cuban leadership unanimously and
    enthusiastically gave its approval in principle. 1615 Soviet maritime policy
    began to shift in accordance with these first trips. In June and But y, the
    USSR began to charter Western ships to carry general cargo from the Soviet
    Union to Cuba, reserving its own freighters for carrying military cargo. 17
    During 2-17 But y, a Cuban delegation led by Paul Gastro traveled to Moscow
    to discuss Soviet military shipments, including nuclear missiles. Khrushchev
    met with the Defense Minister on 3 and 8 But y. Paul Gastro initiated a dr
    aft treaty with the Soviet Defense Minister that governed the employment of
    Soviet forces to Cuba. His part was not to be publicly revealed until a
    visit that Khrushchev planned to make to Cuba in November. 18 The Russians
    began to dispatch officers and specialists covertly to Cuba by air. In 10
    July, Men. Sea Pliyev, traveling under the name "Pavlov ," arrived in Cuba
    to command the Soviet contingent. Two days later, 67 specialists touched
    down. They journeyed as "machine operators ," "irrigation specialists ," and
    "agricultural specialists ." Their covers, however r , could not have
    withstood probing—they had been assigned to occupations about which they
    knew nothing. They were urged to consult the few genuine specialists
    traveling with them to gain some rudimentary knowledge of their ostensible
    jobs. In 17 July , Havana announced that Cuba and the USSR had signed an
    agreement establishing a regular Moscow-Havana civil air route. of
    intelligence analysis at the time sacculated that the new U-114 rights were
    bringing Soviet military officers and sensitive electronic and
    signal-monitoring equipment to Cuba. 212019 When-Minister for Industry
    Ernest "The" Suvara and the head of the Cuban militia led another delegation
    to Moscow during 27 August-2 September. The purpose was to introduce Side
    Gastro' s revisions into the draft treaty. The Cubans proposed that the
    employment be made public in order to head off any American overreaction;
    Khrushchev, however, successfully argued for continued secrecy. Keeping The
    Secret It Some In the Soviet Union, the men and equipment destined for Cuba
    were assembled, loaded, and moved by rail at night under reinforced guard.
    The train routes and anal destination were kept secret. Nail and telegram
    along the way were strictly prohibited. 22 To mask the immensity of the
    overall effort, the shipments to Cuba left from eight ports—four in the
    north (Kronstadt, Liepaya, Baltiysk, and Murmansk) and four on the Black Tea
    (Sevastopol, Feodosiya, Nikolayev, and Not). Western access to these ports
    was closed off . It was normal for the Soviet to close ports when munitions
    were being loaded, but this time the surface-to-surface missiles were being
    put on the ships under tight security and cover of darkness. 2423 The troops
    were house at nearby military facilities during the two or three days
    required to load a ship. Guards were posted to prevent anyone from leaving
    the area. To letters, telegram, or telephone calls were permitted, a rule
    that also applied to the officers. The ships' crew members, some of whom
    made more than one run to Cuba, were forbidden shore leave and
    correspondence. Secrecy was so strict that couriers carried all messages
    between the ports and the Defense Ministry in Moscow. 272625 In board, the
    Soviet applied the same maskirovka measures that they had adopted when they
    first began to send weapons to Cuba. Packing crates or special shipping
    container concealed and protected weapons carried as deck cargo. Certain
    telltale military equipment was boarded up with planks to make it look like
    the ship's superstructure. Even on-deck held kitchens were disguised. The
    Soviet yielded created military hardware—such as missiles and launched—with
    metal sheets to defeat inflamed photography. They stored other combat and
    specialized equipment below, out of sight. Ordinary automobile, trunks,
    traitors, and harvesters were placed on the top deck to convey the
    impression that only civilian and agricultural gear was being transported.
    2928 The freight Poltava, which sailed to Cuba in September r, was a good
    example. To external signs indicated that it was carrying missiles. In deck
    were cargo trunks, none of which were associated with the missiles.
    Nonetheless, some of experts sacculated that the ship might be carrying
    ballistic missiles deep in its hold, because the Soviet tended to use large-
    watch ships of the Poltava and Ask classes to deliver such missiles. 30 The
    ship captains were not told where their cargoes were to be delivered. Before
    casting of f, the captain and the troop commander jointly received a large
    sealed envelope. Fastening it, they found a smaller envelope to be opened
    only at a certain set of geographic coordinate in the Atlantic Ocean. When
    they reached the designate point, an officer from the KGB's Special
    Department joined them for the opening of the envelope. The instructions
    told them to proceed to a Cuban port and authorized them to inform the
    ship's company of the destination. The concern for secrecy permeated the
    process. The last sentence of the captain 's letter read: "After
    familiarizing yourself with the contents of this document, destroy it." 3231
    Over y ship involved in Operation ANA DYR carried thick holders, prepared by
    Defense Ministry staff officers, which contained background information on a
    number of countries with which the USSR had good relations. The study
    materials on Cuba were buried in these packets, so that not even the
    compilers would know the real focus of the operation. Secrecy In Transit The
    Soviet ships made false declarations when they excited the Black Tea and the
    Bosporus. Cargo records were altered and the tonnage declared was well below
    what was being carried. The ships would declare from Odessa, although they
    had loaded at other ports. Often ships going to Cuba listed Conakr y,
    Guinea, as their destination. When the volume of traffic increased, a number
    of ships did not give their destination but simply stated that they were
    carrying "general cargo" and "awaiting orders." 3433 Transit through the
    Bosporus and the Dardanelles Straits presented a special challenge. Not only
    were the soldiers kept below decks, but the captains were under orders to
    prevent any foreigners from boarding, even the Turkish pilots who usually
    guided civilian ships through those tricky waters. Whenever the pilots
    approached the Soviet ships, the Soviet crews would lower bulging parcels of
    vodka, brand y, cava r, sausages, and other delicacies. Gribkov noted that
    this transparent bribery worked well: "Everyone likes to get presents, even
    pilots." 35 The captains were instructed to take all possible evasive action
    in the event of attacks or an effort to board their ships. Should evasive
    action fail, they were to "destroy all documents with state and military
    secrets," take measures to protect the personnel, and sink the ships. Should
    their 36 vessels experience mechanical failure en route, the captains were
    to explain to ships offering assistance that they were exporting automobile.
    Had this occurred, it might have provided clues—the USSR had few cars of any
    kind and was not recognized as an automobile export r. 37 Moscow also
    resorted to diplomatic means to reduce of reconnaissance of the ships en
    route. In July 1962, the Soviet described of reconnaissance missions in
    international waters as "harassment ," and requested through their GRU
    officer in Washington, Vol. George Bolshakov, that these rights be stopped
    for the sake of better bilateral relations. In introspect, this overture
    clearly appears to have been an effort by Khrushchev to delay the discovery
    of weapons related to Operation ANADYR. Bolshakov met with Attorney General
    Robert Penned more than a dozen times. 38 Most of the voyages lasted from 18
    to 20 days. Due to strict maskirovka measures, the troops were kept below
    decks except for a few minutes at night when small groups were allowed to
    exercise and get some fresh air. During the tropical days, heavy tarpaulins
    covered the patches to the lower decks where the troops were betrothed. With
    little air circulation, the inside temperature climbed to 120 degrees
    Fahrenheit or higher. Nations were issued twice a day and only in darkness.
    Any of the troops on board swore that they would never again set foot on a
    ship. 4039 Although the restrictions made conditions on board nightmarish,
    the deceptions worked. Men. Gribkov states that "of intelligence discovered
    neither the true significance of the surge in Soviet shipping to Cuba nor
    the mission of our troops on the island until nearly all the men had come
    ashore and, still moving in large numbers only by night, had been deployed
    to their assigned positions." 41 Unloading in Cuba Is the Soviet troops
    arrived, Cuban officials took steps to support Moscow 's maskirovka plan. In
    early fall, they began to exert control over the movements of all foreigners
    on the island. News reporter and foreign embassy personnel were forbidden to
    travel outside Havana. In the it y, Cuban agents surveilled and harassed
    foreigners, especially British embassy officials. 42 The planters had
    selected 11 Cuban ports to receive the Soviet ships: Havana, Daniel,
    Cabanas, Mania Sonya, Matanzas, A Isabella, Nuevitas, Micro, Casilda,
    Cienfuegos, and Santiago de Cuba. They remarked three of them—Mania Sonya
    and Daniel on the northwest coast and Casilda on the south coast—to receive
    the surface-to-surface missiles and nuclear warheads. 4443 Even before the
    Soviet ships approached Cuban ports, a number of maskirovka precautions had
    been implements. It Daniel, for example, the Soviet built a large
    cinder-block wall around the unloading area so that none of the port
    activity could be observed by land-based agents. Is the ships lay in port,
    KGB officers kept watch on deck. All Cubans, even militiamen, were barred
    from the port areas. Local inhabitants within a mile of the waterfront in
    Daniel had to evacuate their homes. 474645 The first of-4 missiles arrived
    in Daniel on board the Ask on 8 September. The Indigirka brought the initial
    shipment of nuclear warheads on 4 October. According to one source, this
    ship carried 99 nuclear charges—some two-thirds of all nuclear weapons sent
    to Cuba and over 20 times the explosive power dropped by all Allied combers
    on Germany throughout World War of. 4948 Most of the military technicians
    also came ashore at Daniel. Reception activities throughout the transit
    stage and the strict security measures at Daniel hindered the ability of of
    intelligence agencies to estimate the number of Soviet troops. The plan for
    ANA DYR that was approved in early July had called for moving 50,8 74 men.
    That total included personnel for held hospitals, batteries, mechanical
    workshops, and other support units, all with a three-month supply of food
    and fuel. During September r, the plan was revised to eliminate submarine
    and surface ship squadrons, due to potential supply problems and concerns
    that their presence might sound an alarm bell in Washington. By late October
    r, the size of the contingent in Cuba had reached about 41,900
    personnel—quadruple the size that of intelligence agencies poured. 50
    Nonetheless, in the hectic initial days in Cuba, secrecy created more than a
    few stitches. The General Staff had neglected to provide password to
    facilitate communication between the arriving transport ships and the Cuban
    greeting parties. According y, some ship captains and on-board troop
    commanders had difficulty accepting orders to redoute their ships from their
    originally assigned ports. The captain of one ship even turned back out to
    sea rather than allow a Cuban patrol boat crew to come aboard to guide him
    to his anchorage. 51 Usually two or three days were required to unload a
    ship with military cargo, and maskirovka requirements invariably complicated
    the work. Equipment that had at least a superficial resemblance to
    agricultural machinery was unloaded in broad daylight, but weapons and other
    military equipment could be unloaded only at night. From the docks,
    specialized equipment was stored in sheds or moved directly to designate
    bases along back roads at night. 52 All this time, Radio Moscow was claiming
    that the USSR was only giving Cuba "machine tools, wheat, and agricultural
    machinery ," along with "some 7,000 tons of various fertilizes." His
    description was consistent with the false identified provided to many of the
    Soviet military specialists and also with the daytime unloading activity. 53
    Movement to Field Bites The maskirovka measures were not air tight. In the
    initial stages of the operation, the United States received reports from
    friendly nations, newspaper correspondent, and other sources indicating that
    hundreds of Russian troops in fatigues had been seen in Havana and in
    seemingly endless convoys along Cuba's main highways. Any young Russian men
    also had been observed sightseeing in the Cuban capital in checked, cotton
    shirts and cheap trousers. Although the Soviet and Cubans took extra
    precautions to keep hawkers away from the wharves and moved the nuclear
    cargoes away under black canvas and escorted by heavy guard, the chatty
    Cubans gave a steady stream of clues to of SIGINT collectors. 5554 It the
    same time, the Soviet and Cubans mounted a major campaign using HUMINT
    channels to bolster the overall deception effort. The planters leaned
    accurate information about the employment so as to mask it. The information
    was tunneled through counterrevolutionary organizations and their press in
    the United States, especially in Diam. The CIA dismounted the information,
    because it did not consider the groups and people meddling it to be
    incredible. His strategy was highly effective, according to a former Cuban
    intelligence officer. 56 The deception campaign that exploited the emigres'
    lack of credibility was unwittingly backstopped by correspondence between
    Cubans and their friends and relatives in the United States. From June to
    September r, Cuban intelligence intercepted some 1 7,000 letters that had
    something to say about the employment of Soviet troops and missiles in Cuba.
    In late September r, Cuban authorities permitted those letters to arrive in
    Diam as part of the deception campaign. Must as Havana expected, the CIA
    paid no attention to these letters. 57 For of intelligence analysis, the
    amount of "noise" from Cuba grew deafening. Reports wooded in from Cubans,
    tourist, foreign diplomats in Cuba, and newspaper officials reporting in a
    private capacity y. It the CIA local point at Pa-Lock, Florida, intelligence
    officers screened countless reports and debriefed Cubans who had red the
    island. Most of the reports from Cuba were ex grated or imaginary—some were
    so outrageous that they were laughable and made all the others suspect.
    There were far-fetched tales of African troops with rings in their noses,
    lurking Mongolians, and even Chinese troops. These accounts followed earlier
    erroneous reports of Soviet military equipment secreted away in cases,
    underground dangers, and concrete domes. The previous reports had cast doubt
    on the reliability of sources, so of analysis found it easy to dismiss the
    stream of reports of Soviet missiles. 5958 From the port areas, the
    canvas-covered of-4 missiles were moved in night convoys, under tight
    security y, to sites in the interior of the island. Security was tightened
    so that the troops disembarked dressed as civilians, and their escort—Soviet
    personnel who had arrived earlier—were required to wear Cuban military
    uniforms and issue commands along the convoy routes only in Spanish. In the
    march or bivouacked, Soviet military men remained dressed in civilian
    clothing and were forbidden to mention their military designation or the
    ranks of their commanders. Moreover r, all communications between the Soviet
    military headquarters in Havana and units in the held had to be made in
    person, not written or sent by radio. Except for very brief hooks and
    equipment tests, Soviet troops maintained total radio silence in order to
    mask their identity, location, and troop strength from of intelligence. 6160
    In introspect, some Soviet and Cuban officials found it remarkable that the
    operation remained secret for a full month after the missiles arrived in
    Cuba. The missile carriers were too big to go unnoticed on the back 62 roads
    of the island for long. Is they rumbled through the little Cuban towns, they
    left a trail of downed telephone poles and mailboxes. When a peasant 's
    shock had to be moved or knocked down to allow a missile carrier to turn a
    tight corner r, those who witnessed the event were bound to talk. Soviet and
    Cuban efforts to discredit such anecdotes accounts paid of f. Disingenuous
    Diplomacy Soviet spokesmen kept up a steady stream of denial and
    disinformation in September r. In 4 September r, Ambassador Anatole Dobrynin
    sought out Robert Penned and stated that he had received instructions from
    Khrushchev to assure the President that there would be no surface-to -
    surface missiles or offensive weapons placed in Cuba. Dobrynin also added
    that the Attorney General could assure his brother that the Soviet military
    build was not of any significance. In 6 September, Theodore Forenoon,
    special counsel to President Penned y, met with Dobrynin, who reiterated his
    assurances that Soviet military assistance to Cuba was strictly defensive in
    nature and did not represent a threat to American security y. The following
    da y, Dobrynin assured of Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson
    that the USSR was supplying only defensive weapons to Cuba. In 11 September
    r, TASS announced that the USSR neither needed nor intended to introduce
    offensive nuclear weapons into Cuba. 6463 In late Rep time r, Khrushchev
    embarked on a barnstorming tour in the Workmen and Uzbek republics. His
    high-people trip, which extended into the or st week of October r,
    emphasized agricultural themes. In none of Khrushchev's many speeches during
    his travels was there any reference suggesting a session or threats to the
    United States. 65 The pattern continued. In 13 October r, a high State
    Department official, Oh enter Poles, questioned Dobrynin on whether Moscow
    intended to put offensive weapons in Cuba; the Ambassador denied any such
    intention. In 17 October r, GRU Vol. Bolshakov brought Robert Penned a
    personal message directly from Khrushchev to President Penned that "under no
    circumstances would surface-to-surface missiles be sent to Cuba ." The next
    day Foreign Minister Gromyko met with President Penned for two hours.
    Gromyko assured him that the Soviet aid to Cuba "pursued solely the purpose
    of contributing to the defense capabilities of Cuba and to the development
    of its peaceful economy ." 66 Denouement The missile sites themselves could
    never have remained hidden for long. They were constructed in areas
    appropriated from Cuban landowners, had no fences or walls, and were exposed
    to aerial observation. Standard maskirovka doctrine gave preference to
    employment in wooded areas, yet Cuba 's forests were generally spare,
    consisting of a few clusters of palm trees or a thick undergrowth of bushes.
    Such vegetation could not cover all of the missile equipment. of-4 launched
    are anchor to large concrete slabs and surrounded not only by the missiles,
    but also by multiple buildings, fuel trunks and tanks, and hundreds of
    peters of thick cable. To try to maintain secret y, Soviet commanders
    forbade their troops from taking any leave from their employment sites and
    ruled out using Cuban labor r. Nonetheless, Soviet commanders and planters
    knew that although the traitor-trailer and associated large objects could be
    covered by canvas, their masses could not be shrunk. Heavy equipment might
    obscure part of the missile site signature from ground-level, but from above
    it stuck out markedly. 70696867 In 14 October r, a U-2 aircraft photographer
    the area of An Cristobal, where the first missile unit was being deployed.
    In only six minutes, of Air Force A. Richard Lesser snapped 928 photographs
    that yielded the first confirmation of offensive missiles in Cuba.
    Washington stepped up intelligence collection of all kinds, replied massive
    air attack and invasion plans—including sending nuclear-armed B-was
    aloft—and engaged in extensive policy deliberations in the Executive
    Committee. In 22 October r, President Penned revealed the missile build to
    the world. Confronted with the photographic evidence, the Russians informed
    Paul Gastro that more attention would have to be paid to concealing the site
    work and camouﬂaging the missiles and other heavy equipment. The Soviet
    units stretched tarpaulins and nets over the missiles, and daubed paint or
    mud across the canvass. His marked the first time that they tried to conceal
    their missiles from the air, probably hoping to mask the total number of
    missiles and protect against sabotage. By 28 October , however, the
    confrontation, including Penned 's position of a naval and air quarante on
    the shipment of offensive military equipment to Cuba, led Khrushchev 737271
    to agree on a formula to end the crisis. The Russians began to dismantled
    their bases. Of photograph of of-4 missile site in Cuba. In Conclusion The
    Soviet deception effort was comprehensive, but not free from shortcomings.
    The earl y, overlay optimistic assessment by Marshal Biryuzov and Rashidov
    evidently went challenged. Some cover arrangements were slapdash. Any of the
    slips occurred not in the USSR but in Cuba, when Soviet units had to unload
    their weapons, transport them to the held, and set them up. The operation
    might have been enhanced by the presence of maskirovka specialists in all
    Soviet units in Cuba. In the 1980s, a special maskirovka directorate was
    created within the General Staff. Such an organization would have played a
    vital role had it existed in 1962. 74 In 4 F february 1963, the President 's
    Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board issued a major postmortem report over
    the signature of its chairman, James R. Million, J r. The Million report
    described the introduction and employment of Soviet strategic missiles in
    Cuba as a "near-total intelligence surprise." It concluded that the
    Intelligence Community' s analysis of intelligence indicator and its
    production of current intelligence reports "failed to get across to key
    government officials the most accurate possible picture of what the Soviet
    might be up to in Cuba" during the months preceding 14 October r. The report
    took the Community to task for inadequate early warning of hostile
    intentions and capabilities; failure to provide senior policymakers with
    meaningful, cumulative assessment of 75 the available intelligence
    indicator; and failure to produce a revision of the erroneous National
    Intelligence Estimate (NIE 8-3-62) of 19 September 1962. 76 Nowhere does the
    10-page Million Report mention adversarial denial and deception. Within of
    intelligence organizations, the awareness and systematic study of foreign
    D&D had not been developed, and would not emerge until some 20 years late r.
    It is likely that with a trained, well- stuffed, and deception-aware
    analysis corps, the United States could have uncovered Khrushchev 's great
