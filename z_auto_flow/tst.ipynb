      "Transcript: For as long as man has been engaged in war, he has also attempted to use acts of deception to trick and mislead the enemy, in an effort to eke out an advantage over his foes, and perhaps win an otherwise unwinnable victory. From the mythical use of the Trojan Horse, through to more modern examples such as disinformation and psychological warfare, the number of methods used to trick an enemy is near limitless in number, and often incredible in detail and scope. Here are my choices for five of the greatest examples of military deception in history. Number 5. Operation Minskmeet. It's 1943. The Second World War is at its height, the outcome and fate of the world still uncertain. In a windowless room deep beneath Whitehall, British intelligence officers dream up an elaborate plot, designed to deceive the Germans into moving troops away from an Allied invasion target. The body of a nameless drifter is to be stolen, given a fake identity, and then loaded with top-secret documents, before being dumped off the coast of Spain, in the hopes that his body and the falsified military plans he was carrying would fall into German hands. What you're hearing might sound like the synopsis of a fictitious Hollywood movie, but it's exactly what happened in April 1943, when Operation Minskmeet was executed. This audacious deception, the perfect example of extraordinary times requiring extraordinary measures, the corpse of the homeless man who had been ignored and forgotten by the society in which he lived, playing a key role in one of the most successful and creative deceptions in history. A deception which would change the course of the Second World War, and save the lives of thousands of Allied soldiers. By 1943, the Allies had finally pushed Axis forces out of North Africa, after a long and hard-fought campaign, waged upon the sun-scorched sands of the Sahara. Yet the war was far from over, with most of Europe still under German dominion. Allied planners now turned their attention towards the perilous and no doubt bloody task of carrying out an amphibious invasion of the European mainland. With an invasion of Northern France from Britain, widely seen as being unfeasible for at least another year, the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was keen to keep the hard-won momentum going, seeing the recent massive build-up of Allied forces in North Africa as an ideal opportunity to invade Europe via the south of Italy, using the island of Sicily as a staging post. Yet such a solid strategic move was just as obvious to the Germans as it was to the Allies, meaning that any operation following this route would face stiff and well-prepared opposition, that would make the Allies bleed for every inch of ground won. It was clear that to ensure the success of the operation and to minimize Allied casualties, the vigilant German intelligence agencies would need to be convinced that other plans were afoot. Preying upon Hitler's fears that his fortress Europa could be breached via the Balkans, an area rich in raw materials desperately needed by the hard-pressed German war machine, the Allies launched Operation Barclay, an elaborate campaign of disinformation designed to convince Hitler that the Balkans was indeed the planned site of their invasion. A fictional army formation was created in Egypt, equipped with dummy tanks and armored vehicles, used to give the impression to onlookers that forces were being massed for an attack on Greece. If the Germans could be convinced to take the bait, they might send reinforcements to Greece, leaving the true target of Sicily less defended than it otherwise would have been. Yet the problem of just exactly how to convince the Germans that this false attack was true persisted, until Ian Fleming, the author behind the James Bond novels, came up with an outlandish deception that he lifted from the pages of a detective novel he had read years earlier. The plan called for the body of a deceased man to be loaded with classified documents, dressed as an officer, and then dumped at sea in the hopes that it would be intercepted by the enemy, who would view the cache of fake documents as genuine, believing that they had accidentally uncovered secret information about a covert Allied invasion of Greece. Operation Mincemeat was born. The top priority was finding a suitable body, a problem which itself proved to be a big stumbling block. Dead bodies usually have loved ones and family members who might object to the corpse being used as a prop in a military exercise, and in addition to this, the body had to appear as though the cause of death was either drowning or hypothermia, if the plane crash at sea scenario was to be believable. Inquiries were made to morgues all over the country with no success, until eventually a London coroner revealed that he had found the perfect candidate. An alcoholic Welsh homeless man with no surviving relatives, colleagues, friends, or associates to miss him, was found dead in an abandoned London warehouse, having ingested rat poison in an apparent suicide. This forgotten man with no ties to the world in which he lived, proved to be the ideal candidate for the job. His body was placed on ice, while intelligence officers feverishly worked on the task of creating an entirely new personality. For a fictional Royal Marines officer, they had named Major William Martin, a name which was common in the British Army, and a rank which was high enough for it to be believable that he was in possession of important documents, but low enough that he would be unknown to German intelligence. Every possible detail was covered to make the deception seem authentic. Major Martin was even given a fianc√©, her picture tucked into his pocket along with two love letters. The image of the woman inside, actually that of an MI5 clerk. The Royal Marines uniform adorning the corpse, was stuffed with everything that a real officer might be carrying, including identity cards, receipts, and bills, as well as other items which indicated he was a real person, and not simply an alias for the dead Welsh homeless man. Yet the most important baggage was the briefcase packed with classified documents, chained to his wrist. Documents which indicated that the Allied forces gathered in North Africa actually had Greece in their sights, and not Italy. With all preparations completed, the body was made ready and loaded into a submarine, which headed for waters just off the Spanish coast, before the finishing touch of a life jacket was added, to make it seem as though Major Martin had been the unfortunate victim of a plane crash at sea. In April 1943, the body was released into the water, after careful examination of which sea currents would best carry it to the shoreline, where it would be more easily found. A plan which came to fruition just hours later, when a Spanish fisherman found the corpse of Major Martin, floating on the open waters. Spain was chosen because although supposedly neutral in the war, the country was ruled over by the fascist dictator, Franco, who had previously proved more than willing to share intelligence with Germany, and it was also home to a German spy who had become well known to the British. The man ruthless and intelligent, but highly gullible, the perfect target for this particular operation. Spanish authorities quickly seized the body, performed an autopsy, and examined the documents in the briefcase, copies of which quickly found their way into the hands of German spies, before the originals were returned to the British, supposedly untampered with. Yet the British knew this was not true, having placed a single black eyelash within one of the letters to see if it had been opened. The eyelash's absence gleefully noted by British intelligence officers. In a further stroke of planning, the body of the fake Major was given a silver crucifix, to identify him as a Catholic. As a Catholic country, Spanish authorities were reluctant to perform invasive autopsies on their fellow Catholics, and so a brief examination of the body confirmed the cause of death to be drowning, and established the body's authenticity. Whereas a more detailed autopsy would have likely revealed the deception, and discovered that the true cause of death was poisoning. With the plot complete, British spies waited in anticipation to see if the Germans would take the bait, listing Major Martin on the British casualties list as missing at sea, and making desperate attempts to recover the briefcase full of documents, in an effort to convince the Germans of the body's authenticity. Yet they need not have worried. Intercepted German communications revealed their knowledge of an imminent Allied attack on Greece and the Balkans. Operation Mincemeat had been a success. Thousands of German soldiers were pulled away from Sicily to reinforce German lines in Greece, and when the Allied attack on Sicily came in July, the island quickly fell with just a fraction of the casualties that would have been suffered, were it not for the false intelligence. Perhaps thousands of Allied lives had been saved, and Hitler was now forced to divert his attention away from planned offences on the Russian front, to deal with the attack on Italy, an attack which quickly toppled the Italian dictator Mussolini, and contributed towards the eventual collapse of Germany itself. The body of this forgotten man, coupled with the schemes of brilliant men, resulting in one of the most intricate and successful deceptions in history. Number 4. The Feigned Retreat Seeing a fearsome foe apparently fleeing the battlefield in terror, is a sight that soldiers across the ages have longed for. The prospect of a hard-fought battle almost at an end, with glorious victory and a safe return home to loved ones imminent. Elated at the prospect of the ordeal of battle over, the soldier and those at his side break ranks and rush forward, eager to chase the enemy off and seal their victory. Yet all is not as it seems, and the fleeing enemy suddenly halts their retreat, turns around, seamlessly falls back into fighting formation, and begins rapidly advancing on the soldiers who are now winded, isolated, and out of formation. As the enemy's deception is revealed, hope turns to horror, triumph collapses into calamity, and panic spreads through the scattered mass of soldiers, as they are set upon and ruthlessly cut down, their disorganised state leaving them in no position to stop the irresistible advance of their vengeful foe. Such a tale of confidence turning into despair has been repeated on battlefields all over the world for centuries, as time and time again, the deceptive tactic known as the Feigned Retreat has been put to use with devastating consequences for those on the receiving end, turning the tides of battles that changed the fate of entire nations and empires, and the very course of human history itself. An enemy army that, at first glance, might appear to be in the stronger position, perhaps on easily defendable high ground, or simply in greater numbers, can have their advantage neutralised by a skilled commander, who will order his own men to pretend to withdraw or simply run away, thus baiting his opponent into giving chase, breaking his formations and abandoning his chosen ground in the process, leading his army into a carefully prepared ambush, where they can be destroyed while they're most vulnerable. Yet while such an act of deception might on the surface sound like a basic manoeuvre, executing it successfully in the field requires an incredible level of discipline, training and organisation, lest the Feigned Retreat turns into a full-blown rout. Holding perhaps thousands of men together in a coherent manner during a fake retreat under battlefield conditions is an immense task fraught with danger, and as such the tactic is not seen as commonly as you might think, yet with great risk comes great reward. Perhaps the most effective and devastating uses of the tactic occurred during the Mongol conquests, when across the world numerous armies with proud histories and well-trained men were nevertheless lured into ambushes, where they were torn to pieces by the Mongol horsemen, resulting in a butcher's bill that could be measured in the millions, as ancient empires were smashed and the course of human history was altered irreversibly. Discipline and obedience was enforced at every strata of Mongol society, and the constant training on horseback in preparation for war, coupled with the closely knit army structure, made Mongol armies ideal for effectively executing the Feigned Retreat. Mongol cavalry was light, fast and had high endurance, and therefore perfectly placed to carry out tactics that required high manoeuvrability, speed and stamina, attributes that the often heavily armoured enemies lacked. At the height of battle the Mongols would often disengage and run, howling in fear and pretending to be fleeing for their lives in panic. Heartened by this turn of events, the Mongols' enemies would break ranks and chase them, desperate to destroy the menace they presented permanently. Yet the chase would continue on and on, often for days or even weeks, stretching the Mongols' opponents across huge tracts of land, until they were completely disorganised, spread out and lacking any coherent formation. It was then that the hammer blow landed, as the Mongols turned around with lightning speed and charged their pursuers, raining down thousands of arrows upon the shocked men, before the Mongol heavy lancers charged in to whatever remnants had survived the murderous storm of arrows, allowing the Mongols to completely crush armies many times their size by breaking them into smaller groups and then annihilating them at will. Yet despite being so effectively used by the Mongols, this tactic is probably as old as war itself, and has been used on numerous occasions throughout history with devastating results. At the Battle of Hastings, William the Conqueror used a Feigned Retreat to lure the English army away from their strong defensive position atop a hill. Upon seeing the Normans flee, the English broke their shield wall formation and poured down the hill to give chase, only to be mowed down by waves of arrows, before being finished off by a devastating charge from the Norman heavy cavalry, resulting in the death of King Harold and the conquest of England. At Carrhae, the Romans suffered a similar bloody fate, chasing their Parthian enemy who appeared to be running from the battle, only to be caught out of position, flanked and decimated. And as recently as 1943, the tactic was used again at Kasserine Pass, when US tanks chased what they thought was a full-on retreat by the German 21st Panzer Division, only to find themselves advancing head-on into a line of anti-tank guns, which inflicted massive casualties, the battle showing that true military deception is timeless. Number 3. The Siege of Maffeking Surrounded and outnumbered by as much as four to one, a small force of untrained and untested colonial soldiers faced to be what seemed to be the impossible task of defending an unimportant, far-flung outpost of the sprawling British Empire. The 2,000 men, lightly armed and supplied, and facing a highly motivated, well-drilled enemy who were baying for their blood. Any ordinary commander might have simply surrendered, realising that conventional military tactics stood little chance of preventing the fall of the small town. However, the man in charge on this day was anything but ordinary, and the tactics he intended to use were anything but conventional. The town of Maffeking was an unremarkable place, holding little strategic value other than its position near the border between British South Africa and the Boer territories, which were lands mainly inhabited by people made up of Afrikaans-speaking white South Africans, who were descended from Dutch East India Company settlers. Yet, with tensions rapidly escalating between the ever-expanding British Empire and the fiercely independent Boers, war was all but guaranteed, and the tiny, defenceless town of Maffeking would find itself on the front line of what would become a bloody and destructive conflict. When fighting broke out in 1899, the British Army sent Colonel Robert Baden-Powell, with two regiments of untrained colonial irregulars, to garrison and hold the town of Maffeking near the border, with orders to resist the expected Boer invasion of British territory, and in doing so draw enemy forces away from the coastlines, to make the landing of planned reinforcements a more straightforward exercise. While the plan was simple, it was fraught with danger. The town lay extremely close to Boer territory, and it wasn't long before a Boer force, some 8,000 strong, surrounded Maffeking, trapping Colonel Baden-Powell's force of 1,500 men inside. The colonel knew that with meagre defences to speak of and no heavy weaponry, the Boers would easily overwhelm his position if they attacked in force, and so he set about undertaking an incredible series of deceptions, designed to fool the enemy into thinking that there was a larger and better-armed garrison than was actually the case. Under heavy bombardment, with disease raging, food running low, and the town's cemetery quickly filling, Colonel Baden-Powell set to work with the full knowledge that should the Boers learn of the precarious situation the British were in, the game would be up. He immediately ordered his men to construct fake landmines, made from boxes filled with sand, and had them strategically laid around the town with great care, in full view of the Boers and their spies, hoping that these vast pretend minefields would discourage an all-out charge on the hard-pressed defenders. All soldiers were instructed to carefully simulate avoiding non-existent barbed wire whenever they moved between trenches, in the hope that this act might convince the enemy that the town's meagre defences were far more potent than they really were, while guns and lights were continually moved around the town, in the hope that the enemy would overestimate the true size of the garrison. A fake artillery piece was built from a length of steel pipe to make the Boers believe that the town had heavy weapons, and soldiers would even routinely dress as women when carrying out normal activities. In an effort to further deceive the ever-watchful enemy, yet perhaps his most effective ruse, was a forged letter to a friend who had long since died, warning that thousands of British reinforcements were on their way. The letter intentionally lost to Boer hands, force information which forced them to withdraw 1,000 of their best men to guard their rear from the approaching Ghost Army, further reducing the likelihood of the dreaded all-out attack. Over a testing seven months of siege warfare, the wily Colonel Baden-Powell used his repertoire of deceptions to keep the besiegers at bay, until a British relief force finally broke the siege on May the 16th. Just as the situation was becoming untenable, with dire food shortages and mounting casualties, although massively outnumbered, the Colonel had turned a battle of littered importance into a monumental morale boost for the British, a nation for whom until now the war had been going badly. His incredible exploits keenly reported in newspapers across the Empire, the stories written about his cunning tricks, elevating him to the status of national hero, where he returned home to great accolades, before eventually forming the Boy Scouts movement, the resourcefulness he utilised during the siege, living on in the popular worldwide youth movement to this day. Number 2. The Empty Fort Strategy The scene is stark. A small band of men are left with the hopeless task of defending a castle against impossible odds, as a great army many times their number approaches the sparsely manned walls. Every soldier inside knows that this castle that was once home will shortly become his tomb, as a brief but bloody battle awaits which will result in certain defeat and humiliation. Each man makes his peace with the gods, before looking to his trusted commander, ready to receive his final orders and make a bitter last stand against the enemy, in the foolish hope that perhaps victory can somehow be snatched from the jaws of defeat, through the use of some as yet unknown brilliant strategy. However, the commands that are received are met with disbelief amongst the men, as the man who has seen them through a dozen battles, orders his men to throw open the gates, withdraw the sparse defenses on the walls, extinguish all sources of light, and hide inside like cowards. Has the man lost his mind? Or simply given in to fear? Surely such an order will only hasten defeat and death, not prolong or prevent it. Yet he has seen his men this far, and so the orders are dutifully carried out, and the castle is laid bare to the enemy, ready for the murderous forces to pour through the gates and extinguish all life inside. Yet what happens next is beyond belief, as the enemy army camps outside the walls for some time, before cautiously withdrawing, allowing just enough time for those promised relief forces to arrive to bolster the castle's defenses. The day is saved without a single life lost, but what exactly has occurred? While leaving the gates to your castle wide open for the enemy might seem like the worst military tactic possible, surprisingly it's actually a tried and tested strategy that relies on the power of the bluff. After all, if you're already in a hopeless situation, you have nothing to lose. So why not gamble on a bluff that could lead to an otherwise unwinnable victory? What's known as the Empty Fort Strategy involves using deception to forcibly lead the enemy into believing that an ambush is awaiting him, resulting in his full retreat. Instead of securing the gates, they are thrown open. Instead of manning the walls, they are left unguarded. In fact, the strategy involves doing the opposite of everything the enemy might expect, thus shaking his confidence and arousing his suspicions, perhaps even dissuading him from attacking at all. Yet while the strategy might sound as though it completely relies on luck, it actually pivots on the reputations of the two opposing commanders. If the defender is viewed as cunning and the attacker is a cautious general, the plan actually has a high chance of succeeding. Deliberately exposing vulnerabilities goes against basic human instinct and will spark additional caution in an already cautious man. This reverse psychology will make the attacker question your motives and suspect that you're actually stronger than you appear. Perhaps an ambush is awaiting inside or some other cunning trap that will lead to the ruin of his army, thoughts that might make the attacking party delay or abandon their assault altogether. Although uses of the strategy are rare, there are several documented examples. In 195 AD, the Chinese warlord Cao Cao had his castle set upon by a rival warlord's army which was some 10,000 strong. Cao Cao had less than a thousand men to defend with, having sent most of his soldiers away to collect food. So when the enemy army arrived at his gates, he made the decision to remove his soldiers from the walls, and instead replace them with women from the town, in a clear show of weakness, in an effort to make his rival believe that he was walking into an ambush. As Cao Cao had built a reputation as being a cunning general, his opponent viewed the nearby dyke and forest as likely targets for the concealment of a large ambush force, and so made the decision to instead retreat, buying Cao Cao enough time to gather his forces and win in battle shortly after. Yet Cao Cao would have the tactic used against his own men, when after another battle, his forces pursued the enemy back to their camp, keen to finish them off. With scarce few men to defend with, the enemy general gave the order for his men to open the camp's gates, hide all flags and banners, and silence the war drums. This unusual turn of events caused Cao Cao's soldiers to suspect an ambush was awaiting inside the camp, so they retreated, only to be attacked from the rear, and thrown into disarray as the handful of soldiers inside the camp charged out to meet them. Yet it's not just in China that the strategy has been used. Another well-documented account occurred in Japan after the Battle of Mika-Tagahara in October 1572, when after being soundly beaten by a larger force, Tokugawa fled back to his castle, with perhaps just five men remaining. With the town in panic, the gates were thrown open, torches were lit, and the drums were ordered to beat loudly. However, when the enemy scouts saw the spectacle of the brightly lit, noisy, and unguarded castle, they suspected a trap and delayed their attack, instead choosing to make camp for the night, where a small band of 100 Tokugawa soldiers attacked them under cover of darkness, causing a full-scale retreat. Whether foolhardy or genius in its conception, the open-fort strategy shows that military success is not always just about sheer numbers. Number 1. Operation Fortitude With the planning and execution of the D-Day landings in Europe, the Second World War was at a crucial tipping point. Success would mean a swift end to a destructive war that had claimed millions of lives, while failure could prolong the conflict by years, claiming millions more souls, or even result in an Axis victory. Yet just as the invasion was being planned and prepared, so too were a series of deception operations known as Operation Bodyguard, of which perhaps the largest single plot was known as Operation Fortitude. Covert plans which would see a range of high- and low-tech methods of deception used in an attempt to convince the German high command that the Allied invasion of Europe would come via Calais, rather than through the intended route of the Normandy coastline, thus diverting German attention and reinforcements away from the true site of the landings, making the job of securing a beachhead far less bloody for the men on the ground. By 1943, the embattled Soviets were bearing the brunt of the German war machine at a terrible cost, as millions perished as the Red Army and Soviet people desperately fought to hold back the Axis onslaught. With casualties mounting, the Soviets appealed to the other Allies to open up another front in Europe, so that the ferocity of the German assault might be lessened as forces were transferred to the West. The Germans knew full well that an invasion in the West was coming, however, the key question would be where. The entire north-western coast of Europe had been fortified, and while the route between England and Calais was the shortest, it was also the most obvious, and therefore most heavily fortified. For this reason, the Allies were obviously keen to avoid landing at Calais, but it was still deemed to be advantageous to try and convince the Germans the shortest route across the English Channel was indeed their plan. With Allied planners settled on the Normandy beaches as their true target, the campaign to deceive the Germans into focusing on Calais sprung into action, as a cast of spies and list of missions like something out of a blockbuster movie was deployed. German spies who had been discovered operating in Britain were arrested and flipped into serving as double agents, spoon-feeding masses of force information back to their spymasters in Berlin, while decoy communiques were leaked through diplomatic channels in supposedly neutral countries, which were known to pass on information to the Germans. All of it pointing towards Calais as the target. On land and sea, physical deceptions were deployed with inflatable aeroplanes, dummy tanks, fake airfields, and decoy landing craft given widespread use to mislead the enemy in an attempt to give the impression of mass movements of non-existent troops and a build-up of forces in an area that all pointed towards an invasion of Calais. Even the famous US General Patton was involved, on paper given command of a ghost army, equipped with inflatable vehicles and directed by faked radio traffic, that gave the impression that well-respected General, seen by the Germans as the man most likely to lead a cross-channel invasion, had his eyes set on Calais and not Normandy. Phantom units were even placed in Scotland to give the impression that Norway might also be an invasion target, causing the Germans to spread their defenses even further as they sought to cover all of the most likely targets, each one leaving Normandy less and less defended than it would have otherwise been. This elaborate charade continued over the course of an entire year, the knowledge that even just a few hours of forewarning of the real invasion target could result in the doom of the entire expedition and the deaths of countless thousands more men than was necessary. As such, even on the day of the landings, the deceptive ploys continued. Clouds of aluminum strips were dropped near Calais to give force radar readings that would indicate a large fleet approaching the port, while dummy paratroopers were dropped far from Normandy, the mannequins wired to simulate the sounds of battle when they hit solid earth. Special forces even dropped alongside the dummies equipped with phonographs that broadcast the sound of soldiers' voices and weapons fire, all in an effort to confuse the enemy and make them think attacks were inbound from all across the French coast. Intercepted German communications indicated that the elaborate ruse twelve months in the making had been a success, with German forces mustering in greater numbers to protect Calais, while leaving Normandy more sparsely defended. The deceptive measures also confused the German commanders on the ground, delaying movements of vast numbers of reinforcements to the Normandy beaches, as many believed the landings there to simply be a diversion from the real attack still to come at Calais, dissuading them from launching a counterattack, which could have pushed the Allied forces back into the sea. A deception on such a scale has never been attempted before, yet against the odds, the schemes and plots succeeded, ensuring that the Allies were able to establish a beachhead and push on into France and eventually Germany itself, where they would meet up with the advancing Red Army and bring to a close the bloodiest chapter in human history so far. So, those are my choices for five of the greatest examples of military deception. As always, let me know your thoughts in the comments below, and I'll see you again very soon.\n",
